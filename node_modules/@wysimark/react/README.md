# Wysimark for React

Wysimark is the beautiful WYSIWYG editor for Markdown in ReactJS with CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown support that includes file/image uploading and image resizing.

It can be used as a WYSIWYG editor replacement for a textarea used for Markdown.

It is GPL licensed.

Furthermore, it also has these features:

- File and image uploads
- Markdown support in and out is impeccable. See how it does on the `markdown-it` torture test at [Wysimark](https://wysimark.com/) (When you get there, go to the "CommonMark" section)
- It has image resize which resizes the actual image on the server
